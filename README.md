This patch produces what will likely be the first track on an album I'm working on. 
  
It is designed to run as a ReWire slave to some DAW which will accept its 16 audio outs.
Nearly all information regarding the music (besides effects applied in the DAW) are stored or generated by the patch. 
The patch contains an amalgum of sequencers and synthesizers. This is the first time that I tried to do a whole song in a patch and honestly its all a pretty big mess.

The patch needs alot of work. I am currently working on the pattr system for recalling and interpolating presets and generally cleaning the patch in order to improve its reusability.
My goal is to, eventually, create a loose template from which I can generate lots of different tracks.
